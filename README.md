# Deep learning

## Assignment 1
The first assignment was to create an neural network from scratch. 
The assignment was implemented in Rust. 

The goal of the neural network was to classify between four different shapes, which were synthetically made. 
The input of the neural network was images which were synthetically made by the `DataGenerator` class. 
Each image contained one of four shapes, either a circle, horizontal line, vertical lines or a rectangle.

## Assignment 2
The goal of the second assignment was to create a recurrent neural network from scratch. 
This was done using Python. 

The goal of the recurrent neural network was to predict the next sequence of 0's and 1's. 
The input of the recurrent neural network was an image with a special sequence of 0's and 1's.

## Assignment 3
The third assignment went in to the subject of autoencoders.  
The goal of the assingment was to create an autoencoder. An autoencoder is a form
